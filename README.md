# Sentiment Analysis Project
This repository contains a sentiment analysis model designed to classify text into positive, negative or neutral sentiments. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict the sentiment of textual data.

# Features
Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, handling of special characters and negetion handling.

Model Training: Utilizes machine learning models (e.g. RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, GaussianNB) for sentiment classification.

Dataset: Trained on publicly available datasets Twitter sentiment analysis datasets.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score to evaluate model performance. Also confusion matrix helps with determing prediction quality.
