# Sentiment Analysis Project
This repository contains a sentiment analysis model designed to classify text into positive, negative or neutral sentiments. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict the sentiment of textual data.

# Features
Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and handling of special characters.

Model Training: Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or deep learning models like LSTM/Transformer) for sentiment classification.

Dataset: Trained on publicly available datasets such as IMDb movie reviews, Twitter sentiment analysis datasets, or custom datasets.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

Deployment: Includes a simple API or web interface for real-time sentiment analysis.
